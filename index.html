    Hi, my name is Tanvi, along with a girl who codes,
    I am a highly esteemed and accomplished cake connoisseur at EA.
    Below, I will be sharing with you all, my experiences with different cakes.

    Cake 1: Hazelnut Mocha <br />
    Description: The Hazelnut Mocha cake was had an exquisite texture.
    The hazelnut cake was flavorful, light, and slighty spongy,
    and had a light airy, luscious cream
    with a delightful hazelnut-coffee flavor.
    Overall, the hazelnut flaver was thoroughly present, yet and delicious. <br />
    Rating: 4.5/5 (I prefer fruity cakes, otherwise 5/5.)

    Cake 2: Chocolate Raspberry <br />
    Description: This cake had a soft sponge-like texture similiar to Cake 1,
    but the raspberry was <em>too</em> overpowering and tart, especially due to the the raspberry jam drizzle on top.
    The seemingly unsweetened chocolate cake was <em>not</em> well balanced with the potent raspberry flavor and was often overshadowed by it.
    The whipped frosting had a airy and refreshing texture, but the chocolate, in my opinion, was <em>too</em> strong.
    Overall, there was no sweet contrast to the <em>very</em> strong and sour raspberry which would have helped alot.<br />
    Rating: 2/5

    Cake 3: Coconut <br />
    Description: Where do I even begin? The artificialness of the coconut flavoring was very prominent,
    the coconut shaving on the top were chewy and unflavorful, the cake was somewhat soggy like milk cake
    but very unappetizing. But, <em>nothing</em> will beat the awful, artifical, alchoholic taste of the cream which had <thead>
    consistency of liquidy mush. It was <em>disgusting</em>.<br />
    Rating: 0/5

    Cake 4: Mango Mousse <br />
    Description: The cake was a deliciously fluffy and light white cake, and the frosting had a heavenly airiness and fruity flavor.
    The mango was prominent throughout the whipped frosting and had a delightful sweetness.
    Overall, the cake was deliciously light and fruity. <br />
    Rating: 5/5

    Cake 5: Tiramisu <br />
    Description: The cake had the typical spongy texture seen throughout the EA cakes.
    The frosting, on the other hand, was a thicker whipped consistency with a disgusting,
    strong, potent wine-alchohol taste which was also slightly present in the cake.
    The wine flavor completely overtook the coffee flavor <em>usually</em> seen in tiramisu.
    Overall, the wine flavor was too bothersome and took away from my enjoyment. <br />
    Rating: 0/5

    Cake 5: Passionfruit <br />
    Description: The white cake had a pleasent airy and soft yet firm texture.
    The whipped frosting had a just as luscious texture and had a delicious light fruity flavor.
    The fruitiness was perfectly sweet and light and helped create a refreshing and heavenly experience.
    Overall, this cake was a definite best, and was my favorite. <br />
    Rating: 5/5 (would give more) <br />
